# Pliocene-SST-Southwest-Pacific
This repository holds the R Script (Grantetal2022_SWPacificPlioceneSST_Rscript_21092022.R) and R Data associated with  Grant et al., submitted. Regional amplified warming in the Southwest Pacific during the mid-Pliocene (3.3â€“3.0 Ma).  This script uses raw and processed data to undertake analyses to produce the figures and results presented in the manuscript. 

########### Data files in Grantetal2022_SWPacificPlioceneSST_RDATA.R.RData

Biomarkers (Table S2 of manuscript) contains alkenone and TEX index and calibrations

SST_mPWP is compiled mid-Pliocene SST for all sites (including references,age, calibrations and uncertainty)
SST_mPWP_Tex # This includes TEX data (from Biomarkers) formatted for plotting purposes 


SST_2040.df contains historic (HadiSST 1870-1879) and model projections for UKESM and NZESM SSP2 
at 2035-2045AD with Southern Hemisphere seasonal range (JJA - winter, ann - annual mean, DJF- summer)

SST_2095.df includes model values and normalised to historic value (.hist) for SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios for 2090-2100AD,
with Southern Hemisphere seasonal range (JJA - winter, ann - annual mean, DJF- summer)

SST_bimodalMeans_TEX # This is formatted to include lines for TEX data with no modal means for plotting

MIS5e is single site SST data for various scenarios including MIS5e Cortese et al., 2013 (described in text) for plotting
