# Pliocene-SST-Southwest-Pacific
This repository holds the R Script and R Data associated with  Grant et al., submitted. 'Regional amplified warming in the Southwest Pacific during the mid-Pliocene (3.3â€“3.0 Ma)', future implications.  This script uses raw and processed data to undertake analyses to produce the figures and results presented in the manuscript. Data files referenced in the manuscript and used here are found (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7109199)

########### Data files in Grantetal2023_SWPacificPlioceneSST_RDATA.R.RData

#### Biomarkers (Table S2 of manuscript) contains alkenone and TEX index and calibrations

#### SST_mPWP is compiled mid-Pliocene SST for all sites (including references,age, calibrations and uncertainty)
### SST_mPWP_Tex # This includes TEX data (from Biomarkers) formatted separately for plotting purposes 

#### SST_2095.df includes model values and normalised to historic value (.hist) for SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios for 2090-2100AD,
#with Southern Hemisphere seasonal range (JJA - winter, ann - annual mean, DJF- summer)

### MIS5e is single site SST data for various scenarios including MIS5e Cortese et al., 2013 (described in text) for plotting 


### PlioMIP.sites is the site extraction of PlioCore multi-model mean (Haywood et al., 2020)
### PlioMIP.means is the latitudinal means of PlioCore multi-model mean (Haywood et al., 2020) between 140E - 160W and 0.5N - 79.5S
